# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. EDA is a crucial step in data analysis as it helps in understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Loading the Data
- The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using the `read_csv()` function.
- Initial inspection of the dataset is done using methods like `shape` to understand the size of the dataset.

### 2. Data Profiling
- Data profiling involves examining the dataset and collecting statistics and information about the data.
- Differentiating between quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) data.

### 3. Data Quality Checks
Data quality checks ensure that the data is accurate, complete, consistent, relevant, and reliable. This involves:
- **Reliability:** Assessing the trustworthiness of the data source and collection process.
- **Timeliness:** Ensuring data is up-to-date.
- **Consistency:** Checking data consistency within the dataset and across multiple sources.
- **Relevance:** Confirming the appropriateness of the data for the intended analysis.

### 4. Data Profiling Steps
Data profiling varies for categorical and numerical variables. The steps include:
- **Descriptive Statistics Summary:** Provides a high-level idea to identify outliers, data entry errors, and the distribution of data.
- **Univariate Graphical Analysis:** Using bar charts and pie charts for categorical variables, and box plots and histograms for numerical variables.
- **Univariate Non-Graphical Analysis:** Understanding the central tendency, variability, and shape of the data.

### 5. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
Analyzing relationships between two or more variables to identify correlations, patterns, and trends. This includes:
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Using stacked bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and box plots for various combinations of categorical and numerical variables.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Using heat maps, bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, and correlation matrices to understand relationships between multiple variables.

## Conclusion
The EDA process provides insights into the dataset, helping in understanding data quality, identifying patterns, and preparing the data for further analysis.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to perform EDA.

## Notes
- The dataset used in this analysis is specific to the project context and may not be included in the repository.
- Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
